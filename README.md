# CID
Covered Information Disentanglement (CID) corrects the permutation importance bias in the presence of covariates by using a map between permutation importance values and uncovered feature information values.

Run MV_comparison_CID.py for a demo of how permutation importance is biased while CID can recover the right feature importance when there is high multicollinearity between the features.
